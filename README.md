# ticTacToe

This project was created as part of my certification program with MIT xPro.

This is a Tic Tac Toe game created with React.

For future development, I would like to add:
1. a function that causes an end to the game so you can no longer click on the squares after someone wins.
2. Sound effects for each click and game over.
